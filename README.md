# Overview

This project is a visualization of mental health of different country. I start by comparing graduation rates in the United States to the percentage of people diagnosed with a mental illness. I then compare the percentage of the population diagnosed with a few key mental illnesses to the population of each country and then displaying the highest percentage of each.

# Data Analysis Results
Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between mental health diagnosis in America and college graduation rates?
2. Which countries have the worst mental health for each illness, by percentage of population?

Results:
1. There is no correlation between graduation rates over the last 30 years and the rate of mental health diagnosis. As a nation the trend has been that we are staying relatively stable in mental health, but becoming significantly more educated. Another interesting result was that women are surpassing men in terms of percent graduating from college. 
2. The countries that have the worst mental health by % of population is New Zealand, Australia and some Nordic countries (Norway, Greenland).
